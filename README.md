# CWTK

###What is it?
CWTK - or Comp's Widget Tool Kit - is a tool kit for creating commonly used GUI widgets (buttons, textboxes, etc) in your Java 2D Canvas application.

###What is provided:
* Buttons
* Textboxes (almost completed)
* Listboxes (work in progress)
* Radio button sets (todo)
* Checkboxes (todo)

###How do I use this library?
Reference the cwtk.jar file in your project, create an instance of the WidgetManager, and add as many widgets as you desire.
(Note: Since this is still early in development, there is no prebuilt jar yet. This is due to the library still being very incomplete)

###TODO:
* Listboxes
* Radio buttons
* Checkboxes
* Implement an event API to allow for actual applications (Work in progress)
