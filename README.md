# CWTK

###What is it?
CWTK - or Comp's Widget Tool Kit - is a tool kit for creating commonly used GUI widgets (buttons, textboxes, etc) in your Java 2D Canvas application.

###What is provided:
* Buttons
* Textboxes
* Listboxes
* Radio button sets (todo)
* Checkboxes
* Labels
* Extensibility (custom, user-made widgets)
* An event API (see example program TestWindow.java)

###How do I use this library?
Reference the cwtk.jar file in your project, create an instance of the WidgetManager, and add as many widgets as you desire.
(Note: Since this is still early in development, there is no prebuilt jar yet. This is due to the library still being very incomplete)
